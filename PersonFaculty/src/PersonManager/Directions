Create a class named Person with the following constructors and methods
public Person(String first, String last)
public String getFirstName()
public void setFirstName(String first)
public String getLastName()
public void setLastName(String last)
the class should override the toString() method so it returns the first and 
	last name in this format (note the word 'name' is included in the format):  Name:  Frank Jones
	
Create a class named Customer that inherits from the Person class and contains 
	the constructors and methods.
public Customer(String first, String last, String number)
public String getCustomerNumber()
public void setCustomerNumber(String number)
the class should override the toString() method so it returns the value returned by the toString() 
	method of the Person class appended with the customer number. An example of the output is:  
Name: Frank Jones
Customer Number: J54128

Create a class named Employee that inherits the Person class and contains the 
	following constructors and methods
public Employee (String first, String last, String ssn)
public String getSsn()
public void setSsn(String ssn)
the getSSN() method should return a masked version of the social security number that 
	only reveals the last four numbers
the employee class should override the toString() method so it returns the value 
	returned by the toString method of the Person class appended with the social security number.  
		An example of output is:
Name: Frank Jones
SSN: xxx-xx-1111

Implement entry validation as you see fit. As shown in the image, invalid input must be 
	caught before processing can continue. Implement how you see is best (i.e. if-else statements, 
	exception handling, etc).
	
Submission should be at least 4 files (three class files as described above and a tester file)
